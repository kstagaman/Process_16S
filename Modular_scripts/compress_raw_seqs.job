#!/bin/bash -l
# compress_raw_seqs.job

### Queuing variables
# (The d flag is always the raw reads directory)
#PBS -N 
#PBS -d 
#PBS -q fatnodes

#PBS -k oe
#PBS -m ae
#PBS -M 

### Use the script to move the raw sequence reads into their own folder and compress them.
### Keep in mind, doing so means you can no longer run Process_16S on the sequences without first uncompressing them.

### To run job enter:
# qsub compress_raw_seqs.job (Run anywhere)
#		-OR-
# PATH/TO/Process_16S/Modular_scripts/compress_raw_seqs.job (Run within raw reads directory)
